            technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes \

            other asset.",

    1 : "The **moving average convergence divergence** (MACD) is a trend-following momentum \
        indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securityâ€™s price. \
        The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from \
        the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of \
        the MACD called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can \
        function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.",

    2 : "The **simple moving average** (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated \
        by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average.",
    3 : "The **exponential moving average ** (EMA) is a type of moving average (MA) that \
        places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points. \
        An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more \
        significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA), \
        which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period. "
